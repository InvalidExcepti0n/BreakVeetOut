# BreakVeetOut

I had small project for ReVitalize called - BreakVeetOut now updated to HENkaku. 
Hope you can test it and report bugs, as I have still time to make it better :)

For now there is only 15 levels (but will add it more later...)

Controls:

Left pad, Left analog, L trig - move pad left
Right pad, Right analog and R trig - move pad right
X - start playing
Triangle - start bot (auto bot play)

#For level creators, format needs to be like this:

{ 
{3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3}, 
{3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3}, 
{0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0}, 
{4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4}, 
{4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4}, 
};

Tips for blocks
0 - TRANS
1 - BLUE 
2 - RED
3 - GREEN
4 - YELLOW

Added 2 hit blocks for YELLOW and RED (after hit change colour to white so need to hit again)

Hope to see some modifications in future

Have fun
